This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

### Attention!

- Remember to edit the ``package.json`` project name to your choice before installing the node modules, otherwise it will maintain the defaul 'next-eslint-shadcn-template' name, wich can lead to several bugs across your application.
- Also, remember to edit the main ``layout.tsx`` Title to your choice

Now that we made those changes, let's get started!

First of all, install the node packages:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Global styling

This project uses [`shadcnUI`](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for components and global styles, be sure to edit the `global.css` file to add your global variables to the project.

Also, be sure to edit your `tailwind.config.ts` to add your customized classes based on your `global.css` variables. [`See more`](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration)
